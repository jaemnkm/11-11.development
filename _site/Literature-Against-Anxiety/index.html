<meta name="description" content="Since the beginning of time, there has been anxiety in this world, which is the ultra vibration of particles that should merely be vibrating. These particles sometimes get inside the human body, and when they do, they can stay a long time or a short time, or sometimes forever. The human thinks it’s their mind that is vibrating for very good reason: something has gone wrong. They have done something to cause offense. Something has to be corrected or thought of—something has to be fixed in the world. This is a mistake, caused by the vibrations making their way to the brain. The truth is, nothing is any more the matter in the human’s life than in the life of their pet. The vibrations prevent this from seeming so, but if the human can separate the vibrations from the thoughts, this might cause the vibrations to stop. The thoughts in these cases must not follow the tempo or the direction of the vibrations. Instead, it is useful to think of permanent things, disconnected from the human’s life, like vegetables: the celery. The celery lying in the bottom of the fridge has its own unique structure, a structure that carries through so many celeries—celeries all around the world, and all the celeries down through time. Simply, without complication, the form of the celery repeats itself through all the celeries, even if these celeries never knew each other, never met. Isn’t it strange that the celery in my drawer never met the celery in another? Has no idea of its existence? And if they met, they wouldn’t even acknowledge each other with a greeting? How can celery go on, not knowing all the other celeries in the world, and not caring? If one doesn’t want to think of the persistence of celery in times of distress, it’s easy enough to think of toothpaste, how it doesn’t even mind being depleted, day after day, from its tube. Without protest, the toothpaste is separated from the tube and all the toothpaste in it, and it disappears in the teeth and saliva and gums, it is sprayed into the bowl with water. It becomes so diffuse, without protest, without ever considering any other fate, until the whole bottle is emptied of toothpaste, and must be started again. Even then, the toothpaste down the drain never meets its brothers. It merges with all the rest of the water in the sewer, and separates from its own body and never comes together again. All sorts of things allow separation without anxiety. The vibrations that threaten to separate us from our selves, our lives, should be allowed to run free through the body. Rather than trying to stop it, like a toothpaste that never wants to be separated from its brothers, or celery that wants to know all the other celeries in the world and shake their hands, the vibrations that threaten to separate one’s lungs from one’s heart and one’s life from one’s hands and one’s thoughts from one’s family—the vibrations that want to shatter the unity of everything—should be allowed to do their job. Who knows what the vibrations are for? In this way, the heart is separated from the head, knowledge of the world is separated from being in the world, friends from associates, pleasure from duty, everything from everything else, until we are floating disconnected in a sewer. Perhaps the vibrations only threaten those of us who are too unified, who must be shaken up and down so our pieces lie apart from us on the ground, every once in a while: more frequently for those of us who feel a great unity. If the vibrations feel like disunity, it is only in contrast to the great unity we normally feel, that we don’t even notice or take for granted. In this way, all the vibrations shake you up and down—for there doesn’t always have to be unity in this world—but if the mind knows that the vibrations only enter us at those times that disunity is needed, and only enter those things of the world—rocks, humans, bars of steel—that experience unity, the disunity will not be so scary. Know that at the same time the vibrations that plague you, they are plaguing a million other things as well: tree branches, celery sticks, bread knives—and remember in those times when the vibrations are far from you, like across the sea on another shore, that the unity you feel is only in contrast to what will again come: the shaking feeling that visits you, often in the middle of the night, when you are alone, when you have just taken any action in the world, and whenever. Then remember also, when the shakiness invades you, that this shaking is neither friend nor foe. This shaking has its own uses. It is a reminder of the shakiness without. To imagine that it has anything to do with your life is to misunderstand the solitude of celery, the absolute integrity of celery, and the absolute not-neediness of celery, unlike you." />

Since the beginning of time, there has been anxiety in this world, which is the ultra vibration of particles that should merely be vibrating.
<br />
<br />
These particles sometimes get inside the human body, and when they do, they can stay a long time or a short time, or sometimes forever.
<br />
<br />
The human thinks it’s their mind that is vibrating for very good reason: something has gone wrong. They have done something to cause offense. Something has to be corrected or thought of—something has to be fixed in the world.
<br />
<br />
This is a mistake, caused by the vibrations making their way to the brain. The truth is, nothing is any more the matter in the human’s life than in the life of their pet. The vibrations prevent this from seeming so, but if the human can separate the vibrations from the thoughts, this might cause the vibrations to stop.
<br />
<br />
The thoughts in these cases must not follow the tempo or the direction of the vibrations. Instead, it is useful to think of permanent things, disconnected from the human’s life, like vegetables: the celery. The celery lying in the bottom of the fridge has its own unique structure, a structure that carries through so many celeries—celeries all around the world, and all the celeries down through time. Simply, without complication, the form of the celery repeats itself through all the celeries, even if these celeries never knew each other, never met. Isn’t it strange that the celery in my drawer never met the celery in another? Has no idea of its existence? And if they met, they wouldn’t even acknowledge each other with a greeting? How can celery go on, not knowing all the other celeries in the world, and not caring?
<br />
<br />
If one doesn’t want to think of the persistence of celery in times of distress, it’s easy enough to think of toothpaste, how it doesn’t even mind being depleted, day after day, from its tube. Without protest, the toothpaste is separated from the tube and all the toothpaste in it, and it disappears in the teeth and saliva and gums, it is sprayed into the bowl with water. It becomes so diffuse, without protest, without ever considering any other fate, until the whole bottle is emptied of toothpaste, and must be started again. Even then, the toothpaste down the drain never meets its brothers. It merges with all the rest of the water in the sewer, and separates from its own body and never comes together again.
<br />
<br />
All sorts of things allow separation without anxiety. The vibrations that threaten to separate us from our selves, our lives, should be allowed to run free through the body. Rather than trying to stop it, like a toothpaste that never wants to be separated from its brothers, or celery that wants to know all the other celeries in the world and shake their hands, the vibrations that threaten to separate one’s lungs from one’s heart and one’s life from one’s hands and one’s thoughts from one’s family—the vibrations that want to shatter the unity of everything—should be allowed to do their job. Who knows what the vibrations are for?
<br />
<br />
In this way, the heart is separated from the head, knowledge of the world is separated from being in the world, friends from associates, pleasure from duty, everything from everything else, until we are floating disconnected in a sewer.
<br />
<br />
Perhaps the vibrations only threaten those of us who are too unified, who must be shaken up and down so our pieces lie apart from us on the ground, every once in a while: more frequently for those of us who feel a great unity. If the vibrations feel like disunity, it is only in contrast to the great unity we normally feel, that we don’t even notice or take for granted.
<br />
<br />
In this way, all the vibrations shake you up and down—for there doesn’t always have to be unity in this world—but if the mind knows that the vibrations only enter us at those times that disunity is needed, and only enter those things of the world—rocks, humans, bars of steel—that experience unity, the disunity will not be so scary.
<br />
<br />
Know that at the same time the vibrations that plague you, they are plaguing a million other things as well: tree branches, celery sticks, bread knives—and remember in those times when the vibrations are far from you, like across the sea on another shore, that the unity you feel is only in contrast to what will again come: the shaking feeling that visits you, often in the middle of the night, when you are alone, when you have just taken any action in the world, and whenever. Then remember also, when the shakiness invades you, that this shaking is neither friend nor foe. This shaking has its own uses. It is a reminder of the shakiness without.
<br />
<br />
To imagine that it has anything to do with your life is to misunderstand the solitude of celery, the absolute integrity of celery, and the absolute not-neediness of celery, unlike you.
