<br /><br />
A certain type of light illumines
<br />
and yet that word is lost.
<br />
It could be a hearse
<br />
but it is too short
<br />
and sporty.
<br />
The door is glue blue.
<br />
That’s what comes to mind. Illness.
<br />
The blue door is at the bottom
<br />
of the brown building to mark
<br />
an entrance.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The breeze.
<br />
The trees
<br />
oblige.
<br />
Be still.
<br />
Appease
<br />
my heart
<br />
my
<br />
nerve
<br />
long
<br />
gone.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
They ask if I’ll put them in the ground,
<br />
if I’ll put myself in the ground.
<br />
If I stare at two buildings I won’t go anywhere
<br />
but below is what looks like brush,
<br />
wiry plants slanting where the sun
<br />
ascends. Miraculously all remain
<br />
still, though her cry tilts the words
<br />
so slightly. The leaning tower
<br />
appears; the cry
<br />
subsides.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
To be about this.
<br />
Resistance bites.
<br />
I stretch into limits.
<br />
The wall of green sprawls.
<br />
Each at its own.
<br />
The green holds light
<br />
refracting.
<br />
Blinded by
<br />
a mind’s
<br />
eye.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
To want to hold it.
<br />
Raging at you though pursuit is futile.
<br />
That raging sea, desire.
<br />
Three new mouths shot from above
<br />
the nest sharpening its beak.
<br />
Satiation strung from the building-scape.
<br />
The work will wait and work while waiting.
<br />
It becomes about death around now.
<br />
<em>Oh</em> <em>you.</em>
<br />
To affix the loss away from.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
“Buuuhrd.” The bird house sits transmitting light.
<br />
What a sight the sky. Those are clouds.
<br />
A brown vine straggles. Giggle.
<br />
But why think progressively. A habit
<br />
of the human, you mean “hum.” I’m done
<br />
with moving fast. At last, alas. Your curls
<br />
all atopple. That tree a steeple.
<br />
What would one do with names of species?
<br />
The science blinks
<br />
at the scientist’s swagger.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Who are the bad guys raise your hand.
<br />
Well understandably you can’t acquire assertiveness
<br />
just by thinking. The milky sky retreats and she
<br />
eats words. However one might be listening
<br />
the atmosphere glistens.
<br />
“Is that photo of her dying?” “No. she’s alive
<br />
and smiling.” A kind of treaty to attend to
<br />
this penning of what’s heard. The blank
<br />
stare stamps, what’s out there
<br />
seized.

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
An elegant sheet of rain exquisite in its glow.
<br />
“Where are you?”
<br />
“Where do the animals go?”
<br />
Nature droops weighted from water and yet more
<br />
beautiful “Which outfit is prettier?”
<br />
Neon pink and silver lines drown the peeping
<br />
leaves. Aware and noting material is barely
<br />
responding.
<br />
Aware the end is near.
<br />
Not a sheet of rain but shiny pane of glass.
