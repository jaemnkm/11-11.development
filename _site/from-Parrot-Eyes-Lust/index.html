 More of a growl really

          Dear lovely cursor

<br />
                 little line

 from which somehow letters leap forth

 out of which words
<br />
<br />
                warp &amp; wave
<br />
<br />
           &amp; wiggle
<br />

 as certain

                     We knew

<br />
           not only that you like

                to ‘pop’ your knuckles

 but that you do so ‘inside out’

                alternating

 birds loud in the canopy

<br />
                not a hint of the squirrels
<br />
                I see one robin
<br />
                     fat on the lawn

<br />
 hard copy is
<br />
 at least truthier

<br />
                               Spot
<br />
                          right at the soffit’s edge
<br />
                          where invariably
<br />
      I hit my head
<br />
<br />
 Old iron wind chimes
<br />
           you can smell the rust
<br />
<br />
           The rest is time
<br />
<br />
                already at dawn
<br />
             I hear someone’s sprinklers
<br />
<br />
          Lavender hydrangea
<br />
                up against the fence
<br />
<br />
 Squirrel among birdcalls
<br />
<br />
    Kiss of the hummingbird (not seen)
<br />
<br />
    Who in that house
<br />
          all those kids
<br />
             the girls &amp; their boyfriends
<br />
       reads a book?
 <br />
<br />
          Rabbit in the road

    Last night the first June bugs

 hidden behind hastas

       Newspaper ungathered

    at the driveway’s base

                Pulp of the banana

                great lake

                of stomach bacteria

                   awaits

 That clicking, kissing sound

       is the squirrels

<br />
             hum of the first
<br />
                   weekend pilot
<br />
<br />
    Sun suddenly
<br />
       casts its shadow
<br />
<br />
          Hundreds of tiny
<br />
             flying things
<br />
                so small
<br />
             you wouldn’t even notice
<br />
          but for this
<br />
             moment of illumination
<br />
<br />
       Dog’s moan
<br />
          so particular
<br />
          I even know
<br />
          which dog
<br />
<br />
             now, somewhere in the mix
<br />
                a rock dove coos
<br />
<br />
 I know who he was
<br />
 but never really read him
<br />
<br />
 didn’t notice
<br />
 that he’d disappeared
<br />
<br />
          let alone that you’d died
<br />
<br />
 now, 21 years later
<br />
 these brilliant poems
<br />
 shimmer in the light
<br />
             well not the light exactly
<br />
             this gray paper
<br />
             starting to darken with age
<br />
 These beach houses
<br />
       furnished all alike
<br />
    pastels too bright
<br />
          seashell decorations
<br />
       &amp; the promise
<br />
                of an outdoor shower
<br />
<br />
                The “girl” at the market
<br />
             made me happy
<br />
                   with her Russian accent
<br />
<br />
                   The compost of America
<br />
             becoming that much more rich
<br />
<br />
                   The joints of my legs
<br />
             conjoin with the pelvis
<br />
             where just to sit still
<br />
                is not entirely
<br />
                      “pain free”
<br />
<br />
 This gigantic notebook
<br />
<br />
       Gradually the poem
<br />
          unveils itself
<br />
       I hear my son yawn
<br />
                two rooms away
<br />
<br />
       The rain appears to have stopped
<br />
<br />
          but that bird’s returned
<br />
       with its 5-note song
<br />
<br />
          Dear Philip,
<br />
             it’s 5:03 AM
<br />
             nine hours west of here
<br />
             three hours west of Hawai’i
<br />
<br />
    I have to be careful now
<br />
             at the sight of the slightest spider
<br />
                It might be you
<br />
<br />
                   At dawn
<br />
                one finds moths
<br />
                      gathered at the sink
<br />
<br />
       A pickup truck
<br />
          in whose bed stand
<br />
                upright
<br />
             tied tight
<br />
                (bright orange straps)
<br />
             a dozen glass doors
<br />
<br />
       Today’s first jogger
<br />
             heading west along the canal
<br />
<br />
                on a side street the first power walker
<br />
                heading south
<br />
<br />
          Another jogger
<br />
             (the first guy)
<br />
             trotting thru
<br />
          these long shadows
<br />
<br />
                he’s heading north
<br />
<br />
          Nobody yet
<br />
             walking their dog
<br />
          tho I hear one
<br />
                a few doors away
<br />
<br />
 The one we call Psycho Dog
<br />
       loves to hurl himself
<br />
          against the electronic fence
<br />
<br />
             This jogger returns
<br />
                limping
<br />
<br />
       O very pale
 <br />
          golden lab
<br />
       nose down
<br />
          checking the odors
<br />
          as it walks
<br />
<br />
       Majestic blue heron
<br />
          threads the sky
<br />
<br />
             Quick enough rain storm
<br />
          but now all the lawn chairs are soaked
<br />
<br />
          Quiet enough
<br />
          I can hear the guy next door
<br />
       talking on the phone
<br />
          “Okay”
<br />
             he says
<br />
                accenting each syllable
<br />
             the second drawn out
<br />
             nearly becomes two
<br />
<br />
 An old cheese stick in the car
<br />
 just as good as ever
<br />
<br />
                   What are the lines
<br />
                      What                         are the words
<br />
                         I need
<br />
                         to make sense
<br />
                         of my life?
<br />
<br />
       Oooh, scolds X,
<br />
          he was right there
<br />
             right at the edge
<br />
                about to recognize a feeling
<br />
<br />
     &amp; you!
<br />
     meaning me
<br />
                 you had to jump right in
<br />
                 you <i>always</i> do that
<br />
<br />
                         But it’s not
<br />
                     I wanted to say later
<br />
                 driving the dark road north
<br />
     it’s not about feeling
<br />
                     Y has so many
<br />
             he’s paralyzed by the weight of them
<br />
         it’s about doing
<br />
             he needs to do something
<br />
                 Anything at all
<br />
<br />
                 Giant yellow telescope
<br />
             at midtown highrise window
<br />
                 not for the sky
<br />
             but to glimpse neighbors fucking
<br />
<br />
                     The lone skylight
<br />
         was in the second bathroom
<br />
<br />
                             A pile of towels
 <br />
                    
 where I hope to sit
<br />
<br />
                     hop to sit
<br />
<br />
                         How to position
<br />
                             the cycle of texts
<br />
<br />
                     like knowing
<br />
                         for each line
<br />
                     where to draw
<br />
                         the left margin
<br />
<br />
 This howl is my Howl
<br />
         dog’s growl
<br />
             inflected by wagging tail
<br />
<br />
             Hail to the clef
<br />
 Cliff note
<br />
<br />
             Smallest distance between
<br />
                 beats of the heart
<br />
<br />
                     I saw my mother married
<br />
                 only as a toddler
<br />
<br />
                 Try to fathom now
<br />
                 all the difference
<br />
                 that’s made
<br />
<br />
 A tall page
<br />
 to stand for ages
<br />
 Truman is still President
<br />
<br />
         Tho I don’t yet know
<br />
             quite what that means
<br />
<br />
        If a fountain pen
<br />
            where then is the fountain?
<br />
<br />
            The soprano sings
<br />
        Come All <em>Ye Fair &amp; Tender Maidens</em>
<br />
                while the baritone
<br />
                with somewhat less flash
<br />
            intones <em>On Top</em>
<br />
        <em>Of Old Smoky</em>
<br />
                the percussion quartet
<br />
        hyperactive but surprisingly quiet
<br />
            more space between notes
<br />
            than within
<br />
<br />
    What one hears
<br />
        decades on
<br />
            will differ
<br />
An auditorium filled
<br />
        with white hair
<br />
            (Who will hear
<br />
        George Crumb
<br />
        once his generation’s gone?)
<br />
<br />
I don’t sculpt Google
<br />
    nor ogle giggles
<br />
            but each letter
<br />
        is somehow carved
<br />
    from what?
<br />
        from who?
<br />
    from how
<br />
<br />
From here I look out on a room
<br />
        that my children
<br />
            might imagine as primal
<br />
        as I do that one
<br />
gone so long ago
<br />
<br />
            The television in the corner
<br />
        to the right of the fireplace
<br />
    in front of a case
<br />
            filled with books
<br />
<br />
                    The Big Book
<br />
                of Little Stanzas
<br />
<br />
            including the one
<br />
                I thought last night
<br />
            to write
<br />
                right here
<br />
<br />
Bowl of frozen meatballs
<br />
microwaved
<br />
for my son’s breakfast
<br />
        fills the air
<br />
eau d’ meat
<br />
<br />
        The great busyness of dreams
<br />
    does not survive
<br />
            the violence
<br />
        of the electronic toothbrush
<br />
                placed in one’s head
<br />
<br />
    What was I doing?
<br />
<br />
                Am I doing it still?
<br />
<br />
    Some threat to the dream
<br />
            but vague
<br />
    &amp; not immediate
<br />
<br />
    So that all I recall
<br />
        is the desert climate
<br />
            warm but not oppressive
<br />
        the sun in great quantity
<br />
<br />
Word order in Turkish
<br />
matters far less
<br />
enabling different forms of play
<br />
<br />
                    Man bites dog
<br />
                        well not quite
<br />
<br />
                    With that much room
<br />
                    I’d never back out of the driveway
<br />
<br />
                    The Age of Melted Wax
<br />
<br />
                        NCIS
<br />
                        not the agency
<br />
                            the show is all about
<br />
                        expectations of privacy
<br />
<br />
Few &amp; far between
<br />
                                2 hidden assumptions
<br />
                                    the line, the margin
<br />
                                    An old song
<br />
                                from World War I
<br />
                                    <em>Over There</em>
<br />
<br />
By using a notebook, do I become quaint?
<br />
<br />
        Magnetized hooks
<br />
            on the side of the fridge
<br />
        Some Civil War vets
<br />
            still were alive
<br />
                when I was a child
<br />
<br />
        The “paper boy”
<br />
            is a middle-aged man
<br />
        in a large sedan
<br />
<br />
            you could track
<br />
        the history
<br />
    not just of
<br />
        retail capital
<br />
    but of technology itself
<br />
        through the rise
<br />
            &amp; later demise
<br />
                of the video store
<br />
<br />
    Tasteless “dots”
<br />
        marketed as
<br />
            The Future of Ice Cream
<br />
<br />
The way the Beats distrusted
<br />
Ferlinghetti’s sense of business
<br />
while sending City Lights their manuscripts
<br />
<br />
                        Each sentence fills with sorrow
<br />
                    What if history itself
<br />
                        should not endure?
<br />
            Joe Brainard’s
<br />
                <em>Nancy as an ashtray</em>
<br />
                    reflects a curious misogyny
<br />
<br />
                                A bias
<br />
                                 in haiku
<br />
                                againt titles
<br />
<br />
                    The winter of
<br />
                    short skirts
<br />
                        &amp; long boots
<br />
<br />
                Who reads
<br />
                Rod McKuen now?
<br />
            I climb the long stairs
<br />
                to the floor on which
<br />
                    in the far rear corner
<br />
                they stock poetry
<br />
        Outside, from a card table
<br />
            an old couple
<br />
                sell plates from Iznik
<br />
        A young man pops in my face
<br />
to implore
<br />
        Will you save a mountain tonight?
<br />
<br /></p>
