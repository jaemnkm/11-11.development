<meta name="description" content="Dodie Bellamy’s writing focuses on sexuality, politics, and narrative experimentation, challenging the distinctions between fiction, essay, and poetry. She is the 2018–19 subject of the CCA Wattis Institute for Contemporary Art’s On Our Mind program, a year-long series of public events, commissioned essays, and reading group meetings inspired by an artist’s writing and lifework. Her most recent collection is When the Sick Rule the World, from Semiotext(e). Her essay, “The Beating of Our Hearts,” was included in the 2014 Whitney Biennial. With Kevin Killian she edited for Nightboat Books Writers Who Love Too Much: New Narrative 1977–1997. She is currently working on a novel in which she looks back at the eros of the early days of the internet, with both nostalgia and dread." />
