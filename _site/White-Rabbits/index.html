<meta name="description" content="Ye-ye always had a pocketful of White Rabbit candies for me when I was a child. The first time, I was three, maybe four. Ye-ye put a White Rabbit in the palm of his hand, then quickly closed both fists, shook both hands, and opened them. The candy was gone. Then he closed his fists and had me pick one. I tapped a knuckle, and he smiled. He opened his hand and there lay the White Rabbit. Who could resist? The white wrappers with the red and blue bands, the outline of the rabbit on the side. I untwisted the wrapper and found another piece of clear plastic around the white taffy, which I tried to peel off, but Ye-ye shook his head, and showed me how to put the candy on my tongue. Miracle of miracles, the &quot;plastic&quot; wrap began to melt. It was paper made from rice paste, and it dissolved like a communion wafer on my tongue, revealing the sweet taffy beneath. This was what love tasted like when I was three: like magic and sugar and pounded rice paste. My mother and father didn&#39;t want me to eat candy. They said candy would rot my teeth out. But eating White Rabbits was a religious experience for me now. There was no turning back. Ye-ye didn&#39;t have any teeth. He wore dentures, which he put in a glass beside his bed at night to soak. I saw them floating in the glass free of his mouth when he spent the summers with us in our house in Southern California after my brother, Nathan, was born. Nai-nai had died that spring, and my parents thought Ye-ye would be lonely. I also think they knew he would be willing to look after me for free. My mother was tense and tired and everything I did made her upset. I thought that would eventually change after the baby grew up a little bit, after the crying stopped, or grew less frequent. The moment I woke up, I would sit up in my bed and wait for Ye-ye to come, the second earliest riser. He&#39;d peek into my room, and I&#39;d hold up my arms, and he&#39;d come and pull me out of bed. Ye-ye took me for walks in the ancient stroller. The dew still glistened on the lawns, the air had a faint chill. He&#39;d walk me to the corner and back, all by ourselves. We felt daring in the world. This arrangement continued for years. Ye-ye coming for the summer, my brother taking all my mother&#39;s energy. Ye-ye and I only got lost once. By then I was six, and Nathan had an earache. It seemed to last the entire summer. He cried all the time. Mama was irritable. Everything I did made her tense. Same old. We began as we always had. Ye-ye and I walked hand-in-hand up the shaded sidewalks before the sun had risen high enough to burn the dew off and scorch the air. Then we went a little farther than usual, all the way to the corner, and then across that street, and up the block to the big house with gray turrets and large dense fruit trees. The owners were an elderly white couple and they had pomegranates. I&#39;d gone on a field trip for kindergarten and I remembered the way. The nice couple had picked pomegranates from their trees and sliced them open and placed them on picnic tables covered with plastic red-and-white tablecloths. We&#39;d all been given a quarter pomegranate to suck the seeds out of. It was morning and I was hungry, and who knew when my mother would get up and make breakfast anymore. &quot;I know a good place to go,&quot; I told Ye-ye, and we set off. But when we got to the corner, I could see the house but it was nothing like the friendly welcoming home of my memory. The tall wrought-iron gates were not tied open with streamers; there were not lines of elementary school children on the lawn with paper plates in their hands. The house was dark, shadowed, the pomegranate trees overgrown, the shade dripping from the eaves and the leaf-laden branches menacing. Even the spiky turrets of the house, which had made it seem castle-like on the field trip, now appeared threatening, as though a witch not a princess might live inside. I froze in place, Ye-ye&#39;s warm hand in mine. A bird cawed overhead. Some kind of jay. It flew into the tree, then seemed caught in the sticky darkness. Its cawing turned distressful, a shriek. I squeezed Ye-ye&#39;s hand. He patted my head. Ye-ye looked left and right. I knew he was wondering which way to go. At first I couldn&#39;t move, then all at once, I knew we needed to run. I pulled Ye-ye&#39;s hand and we turned, crossed to the sunny side of the street. I knew there was another way home. A way only in the sunshine. There was a little girl, Karen, whose house I&#39;d gone to for a birthday party. I could picture the house, white with blue shutters, and an orange tree in the lawn, a Big Wheel on the lawn. I felt certain we could reach it. I had walked to the house with Mama pushing Nathan&#39;s stroller. We walked another block. Ye-ye followed me, patiently, trusting me. The sun was moving higher in the sky, the shadows retreating, but I didn&#39;t feel safe yet from the inky shaded witchy house. We walked and walked. And then I was lost. I knew we should turn. We turned and turned but what should have been our street, our house, our copse of avocado trees, was a different house, one with a chain-link fence and a large German Shepherd with nicked ears staring through the wire. The dog barked, his harsh voice like electric volts to my heart. Ye-ye felt it, and gripped my hand too tightly, it hurt my fingers, and he pulled me along, but he couldn&#39;t walk very fast. Still he pulled me alongside him, and I didn&#39;t dare say Ouch, until we were out of range of the dog, a block and a turn away. We could hear the echo of his bark, but he was nowhere to be seen, and he surely couldn&#39;t see us either, I hoped. We were truly lost then. There was an old white man on a lawn chair in front of one of the houses. He wore shorts and an undershirt and his belly poked out from his shorts. He held a limp hose in one hand. Water trickled from its mouth. There were patches of dirt on his lawn, and dandelions, the kind my father would not tolerate on ours. The moment a single one appeared, Papa would march out with his garden spade and his thick gloves and a plastic trash bag, and he&#39;d dig the dandelion up, all the way to the root, and bag it, and tie the bag, and put it in the trash barrel before it could spread, he said. We were one of only a handful of Chinese families in our town in those days, and Papa felt it was important to show everyone that we understood the rules, that we knew how to keep our lawn nice, that we belonged. The white man stared at us, and Ye-ye hesitated. I knew he was thinking we could ask the man for directions, but I didn&#39;t want to. I was afraid of the man. I prayed in my thoughts, Ye-ye, no, we can&#39;t stop here. Ever since I was very little, before I could talk, I knew if I thought hard enough, Ye-ye would hear me and understand. No, Ye-ye, I prayed. We can&#39;t stop. Ye-ye understood, and we kept walking. The sun was very high overhead, and it was hot. Ye-ye was wearing his long sleeved jacket, and he stopped and took it off, and folded it in half, and half again, and tucked it under his arm. He took my right hand again in his left. My hand was hot and sticky and sweaty, but still he held me tightly. We walked until Ye-ye suddenly had to stop on some stranger&#39;s lawn. He led me to a large shade tree, and he leaned his hand against the trunk. He took out his white handkerchief and wiped his face, and neck, and then the top of his head. We were standing on the grass, which white people would not like. I knew from experience when my best friend, Gabby Ocampo, and I ran across the mean neighbor&#39;s lawn next to Gabby&#39;s house, and the old white woman had run out and shouted, &quot;You brats get off my lawn!&quot; Ye-ye sat down on the lawn and patted the grass so that I would sit next to him. I was afraid we were going to get in trouble; there were white people in the house, looking at us through a crack in the curtains of their front window. I saw them flickering there, the curtains rippling, back and forth. But I obeyed and sat on the grass. Ye-ye reached into his jacket pocket and pulled out a handful of very melted White Rabbits. Ye-ye&#39;s eyes twinkled as we both sucked on our candies, resisting the urge to chew, him because it was bad for his dentures, me out of solidarity. Except at the last minute when I absolutely couldn&#39;t stand it and I had to chomp on the candy until it was gone. Then like magic, Papa and Mama drove by in our Buick. They were driving slowly, all the windows down, and I saw them, and jumped up and ran towards them. Mama shouted, &quot;Ning-ning, don&#39;t run into the street!&quot; And I froze in place. Papa parked the car right there in the middle of the street. He jumped out of the driver&#39;s side, and I thought, We are saved! Then he ran over to me, and swatted me on the ass, once, twice, three times. &quot;Bad girl!&quot; he said. And swatted me again. I was too old for this. It wasn&#39;t the pain that made me grimace and fight back my tears as I stood there on the sidewalk in front of Ye-ye, in front of the white family who were watching from behind the curtains of their picture window. The indignity. Papa dragged me by the arm to the car. He opened the back door and said, &quot;Get in!&quot; Then he pushed me inside and I sat down, even though the hot vinyl burned the back of my legs. Then Papa went to get Ye-ye, and he helped him up slowly, and he took his arm, and walked him to the other side of the car. Mama said, &quot;Poor Ye-ye. Oh, poor Ye-ye. He could have had a stroke in this heat.&quot; Nathan was on her lap and he started to whimper. Ye-ye said something to Papa in Chinese that I couldn&#39;t understand and Papa said something in Chinese back, only very loudly, and over and over. Then Mama said, &quot;Ning-ning, what were you thinking?&quot; That&#39;s how it was, ever since Nathan was born. I was blamed for everything that went wrong. His illness, his crying all the time, his having to go to the hospital, all the tests, all the doctors. &quot;Ning-ning, I&#39;m ashamed of you. You know you&#39;re not supposed to leave the house alone. What has gotten into you?&quot; And I thought like saying, But I wasn&#39;t alone. I was with Ye-ye. But I didn&#39;t say it. Which turned out to be a good thing, because the next thing Mama said was, &quot;You could have gotten Ye-ye killed. You&#39;re lucky we found you.&quot; And that&#39;s when I cried for real, tears and snot and shame, in front of everyone. After that, my parents became fearful. I wasn&#39;t allowed to go out by myself, and I wasn&#39;t allowed to go on walks with Ye-ye. &quot;He&#39;s forgetful. He&#39;s not himself. You&#39;re too much for him.&quot; The next year, Ye-ye didn&#39;t come for the summer at all. He stayed in his apartment in New York City with my uncle. In fact, he wouldn&#39;t visit again in person ever. Traveling had become too hard for him. However, he continued to send me White Rabbits in a box for my birthday and New Year&#39;s, along with a red envelope, every year until he died when I was eleven. I didn&#39;t have White Rabbits again until I went to China on a study abroad trip my junior year of college. In advance of Spring Festival, the street stalls were suddenly full of bins and bins of White Rabbit candies. Walking the streets around the campus of Nanjing University, I was thrilled to see the candy of my youth. I immediately bought a bag full and brought them back to the dorm. I passed them around to everyone I met. &quot;I loved these when I was a child,&quot; I explained. The old man who sat in the guardhouse at the gate politely took a handful but the women who worked in the building merely shook their heads and laughed uncomfortably. My Chinese roommate looked on in horror. &quot;My grandmother liked those,&quot; she said. I knew I was a disappointment to her. This whole mixed-nationality roommate situation was an experiment on campus, a sign of China&#39;s emergence from decades of seclusion, and was supposed to be an honor. My roommate had signed up and gone through some kind of rigorous screening process. She had been promised an American, and she&#39;d expected some chic, blonde white girl with exotic ways and instead she got me, a Chinese American with cheap taste. Back in our room she pulled out a Toblerone roll from the drawer of her desk and popped a piece in her mouth to make her point. After that I kept my fetish to myself. But every morning when I woke, the loudspeaker outside our window blaring music for the morning exercises that my roommate and I refused to rise for, I reached from the cocoon of my comforter into the frosty air of our unheated dorm room, and pulled a new White Rabbit from the bag I kept on my desk. I untwisted the familiar white wrapper with the red and blue stripes and the rabbit outlined in blue on the side and popped the candy into my mouth. Pulling my comforter around me, I closed my eyes, as the sensuous layer of sweetened rice paper melted into the milky taffy. I&#39;d come to Nanjing hoping to find some connection to my past, something that would perhaps console me, make up for the losses, for the sense of something missing in me, the hole that was always there in my life in America. But I was no fool. I knew that my grandfather was dead and the China of his memories was gone too, and the Chinese who lived now were rapidly throwing off the past and embracing a future of their own creation. Nothing in China was quite what I&#39;d expected or hoped for. But secretly savoring my White Rabbit each morning gave me courage and sugar and just enough nostalgia to ready myself to get out of bed and embrace the new day." />

He cried all the time. Mama was irritable. Everything I did made her tense. Same old. We began as we always had. Ye-ye and I walked hand-in-hand up the shaded sidewalks before the sun had risen high enough to burn the dew off and scorch the air. Then we went a little farther than usual, all the way to the corner, and then across that street, and up the block to the big house with gray turrets and large dense fruit trees. The owners were an elderly white couple and they had pomegranates. I&#39;d gone on a field trip for kindergarten and I remembered the way. The nice couple had picked pomegranates from their trees and sliced them open and placed them on picnic tables covered with plastic red-and-white tablecloths. We&#39;d all been given a quarter pomegranate to suck the seeds out of. It was morning and I was hungry, and who knew when my mother would get up and make breakfast anymore. &quot;I know a good place to go,&quot; I told Ye-ye, and we set off. But when we got to the corner, I could see the house but it was nothing like the friendly welcoming home of my memory. The tall wrought-iron gates were not tied open with streamers; there were not lines of elementary school children on the lawn with paper plates in their hands. The house was dark, shadowed, the pomegranate trees overgrown, the shade dripping from the eaves and the leaf-laden branches menacing. Even the spiky turrets of the house, which had made it seem castle-like on the field trip, now appeared threatening, as though a witch not a princess might live inside. I froze in place, Ye-ye&#39;s warm hand in mine. A bird cawed overhead. Some kind of jay. It flew into the tree, then seemed caught in the sticky darkness. Its cawing turned distressful, a shriek. I squeezed Ye-ye&#39;s hand. He patted my head. Ye-ye looked left and right. I knew he was wondering which way to go. At first I couldn&#39;t move, then all at once, I knew we needed to run. I pulled Ye-ye&#39;s hand and we turned, crossed to the sunny side of the street. I knew there was another way home. A way only in the sunshine. There was a little girl, Karen, whose house I&#39;d gone to for a birthday party. I could picture the house, white with blue shutters, and an orange tree in the lawn, a Big Wheel on the lawn. I felt certain we could reach it. I had walked to the house with Mama pushing Nathan&#39;s stroller. We walked another block. Ye-ye followed me, patiently, trusting me. The sun was moving higher in the sky, the shadows retreating, but I didn&#39;t feel safe yet from the inky shaded witchy house. We walked and walked. And then I was lost. I knew we should turn. We turned and turned but what should have been our street, our house, our copse of avocado trees, was a different house, one with a chain-link fence and a large German Shepherd with nicked ears staring through the wire. The dog barked, his harsh voice like electric volts to my heart. Ye-ye felt it, and gripped my hand too tightly, it hurt my fingers, and he pulled me along, but he couldn&#39;t walk very fast. Still he pulled me alongside him, and I didn&#39;t dare say Ouch, until we were out of range of the dog, a block and a turn away. We could hear the echo of his bark, but he was nowhere to be seen, and he surely couldn&#39;t see us either, I hoped. We were truly lost then. There was an old white man on a lawn chair in front of one of the houses. He wore shorts and an undershirt and his belly poked out from his shorts. He held a limp hose in one hand. Water trickled from its mouth. There were patches of dirt on his lawn, and dandelions, the kind my father would not tolerate on ours. The moment a single one appeared, Papa would march out with his garden spade and his thick gloves and a plastic trash bag, and he&#39;d dig the dandelion up, all the way to the root, and bag it, and tie the bag, and put it in the trash barrel before it could spread, he said. We were one of only a handful of Chinese families in our town in those days, and Papa felt it was important to show everyone that we understood the rules, that we knew how to keep our lawn nice, that we belonged. The white man stared at us, and Ye-ye hesitated. I knew he was thinking we could ask the man for directions, but I didn&#39;t want to. I was afraid of the man. I prayed in my thoughts, Ye-ye, no, we can&#39;t stop here. Ever since I was very little, before I could talk, I knew if I thought hard enough, Ye-ye would hear me and understand. No, Ye-ye, I prayed. We can&#39;t stop. Ye-ye understood, and we kept walking. The sun was very high overhead, and it was hot. Ye-ye was wearing his long sleeved jacket, and he stopped and took it off, and folded it in half, and half again, and tucked it under his arm. He took my right hand again in his left. My hand was hot and sticky and sweaty, but still he held me tightly. We walked until Ye-ye suddenly had to stop on some stranger&#39;s lawn. He led me to a large shade tree, and he leaned his hand against the trunk. He took out his white handkerchief and wiped his face, and neck, and then the top of his head. We were standing on the grass, which white people would not like. I knew from experience when my best friend, Gabby Ocampo, and I ran across the mean neighbor&#39;s lawn next to Gabby&#39;s house, and the old white woman had run out and shouted, &quot;You brats get off my lawn!&quot; Ye-ye sat down on the lawn and patted the grass so that I would sit next to him. I was afraid we were going to get in trouble; there were white people in the house, looking at us through a crack in the curtains of their front window. I saw them flickering there, the curtains rippling, back and forth. But I obeyed and sat on the grass. Ye-ye reached into his jacket pocket and pulled out a handful of very melted White Rabbits. Ye-ye&#39;s eyes twinkled as we both sucked on our candies, resisting the urge to chew, him because it was bad for his dentures, me out of solidarity. Except at the last minute when I absolutely couldn&#39;t stand it and I had to chomp on the candy until it was gone. Then like magic, Papa and Mama drove by in our Buick. They were driving slowly, all the windows down, and I saw them, and jumped up and ran towards them. Mama shouted, &quot;Ning-ning, don&#39;t run into the street!&quot; And I froze in place. Papa parked the car right there in the middle of the street. He jumped out of the driver&#39;s side, and I thought, We are saved! Then he ran over to me, and swatted me on the ass, once, twice, three times. &quot;Bad girl!&quot; he said. And swatted me again. I was too old for this. It wasn&#39;t the pain that made me grimace and fight back my tears as I stood there on the sidewalk in front of Ye-ye, in front of the white family who were watching from behind the curtains of their picture window. The indignity. Papa dragged me by the arm to the car. He opened the back door and said, &quot;Get in!&quot; Then he pushed me inside and I sat down, even though the hot vinyl burned the back of my legs. Then Papa went to get Ye-ye, and he helped him up slowly, and he took his arm, and walked him to the other side of the car. Mama said, &quot;Poor Ye-ye. Oh, poor Ye-ye. He could have had a stroke in this heat.&quot; Nathan was on her lap and he started to whimper. Ye-ye said something to Papa in Chinese that I couldn&#39;t understand and Papa said something in Chinese back, only very loudly, and over and over. Then Mama said, &quot;Ning-ning, what were you thinking?&quot; That&#39;s how it was, ever since Nathan was born. I was blamed for everything that went wrong. His illness, his crying all the time, his having to go to the hospital, all the tests, all the doctors. &quot;Ning-ning, I&#39;m ashamed of you. You know you&#39;re not supposed to leave the house alone. What has gotten into you?&quot; And I thought like saying, But I wasn&#39;t alone. I was with Ye-ye. But I didn&#39;t say it. Which turned out to be a good thing, because the next thing Mama said was, &quot;You could have gotten Ye-ye killed. You&#39;re lucky we found you.&quot; And that&#39;s when I cried for real, tears and snot and shame, in front of everyone. After that, my parents became fearful. I wasn&#39;t allowed to go out by myself, and I wasn&#39;t allowed to go on walks with Ye-ye. &quot;He&#39;s forgetful. He&#39;s not himself. You&#39;re too much for him.&quot; The next year, Ye-ye didn&#39;t come for the summer at all. He stayed in his apartment in New York City with my uncle. In fact, he wouldn&#39;t visit again in person ever. Traveling had become too hard for him. However, he continued to send me White Rabbits in a box for my birthday and New Year&#39;s, along with a red envelope, every year until he died when I was eleven. I didn&#39;t have White Rabbits again until I went to China on a study abroad trip my junior year of college. In advance of Spring Festival, the street stalls were suddenly full of bins and bins of White Rabbit candies. Walking the streets around the campus of Nanjing University, I was thrilled to see the candy of my youth. I immediately bought a bag full and brought them back to the dorm. I passed them around to everyone I met. &quot;I loved these when I was a child,&quot; I explained. The old man who sat in the guardhouse at the gate politely took a handful but the women who worked in the building merely shook their heads and laughed uncomfortably. My Chinese roommate looked on in horror. &quot;My grandmother liked those,&quot; she said. I knew I was a disappointment to her. This whole mixed-nationality roommate situation was an experiment on campus, a sign of China&#39;s emergence from decades of seclusion, and was supposed to be an honor. My roommate had signed up and gone through some kind of rigorous screening process. She had been promised an American, and she&#39;d expected some chic, blonde white girl with exotic ways and instead she got me, a Chinese American with cheap taste. Back in our room she pulled out a Toblerone roll from the drawer of her desk and popped a piece in her mouth to make her point. After that I kept my fetish to myself. But every morning when I woke, the loudspeaker outside our window blaring music for the morning exercises that my roommate and I refused to rise for, I reached from the cocoon of my comforter into the frosty air of our unheated dorm room, and pulled a new White Rabbit from the bag I kept on my desk. I untwisted the familiar white wrapper with the red and blue stripes and the rabbit outlined in blue on the side and popped the candy into my mouth. Pulling my comforter around me, I closed my eyes, as the sensuous layer of sweetened rice paper melted into the milky taffy. I&#39;d come to Nanjing hoping to find some connection to my past, something that would perhaps console me, make up for the losses, for the sense of something missing in me, the hole that was always there in my life in America. But I was no fool. I knew that my grandfather was dead and the China of his memories was gone too, and the Chinese who lived now were rapidly throwing off the past and embracing a future of their own creation. Nothing in China was quite what I&#39;d expected or hoped for. But secretly savoring my White Rabbit each morning gave me courage and sugar and just enough nostalgia to ready myself to get out of bed and embrace the new day.","@context":"http://schema.org"}</script>

<br /><br />
Ye-ye always had a pocketful of White Rabbit candies for me when I was a child.
<br />
<br />
The first time, I was three, maybe four. Ye-ye put a White Rabbit in the palm of his hand, then quickly closed both fists, shook both hands, and opened them. The candy was gone. Then he closed his fists and had me pick one.
<br />
<br />
I tapped a knuckle, and he smiled. He opened his hand and there lay the White Rabbit.
<br />
<br />
Who could resist? The white wrappers with the red and blue bands, the outline of the rabbit on the side. I untwisted the wrapper and found another piece of clear plastic around the white taffy, which I tried to peel off, but Ye-ye shook his head, and showed me how to put the candy on my tongue. Miracle of miracles, the "plastic" wrap began to melt. It was paper made from rice paste, and it dissolved like a communion wafer on my tongue, revealing the sweet taffy beneath. This was what love tasted like when I was three: like magic and sugar and pounded rice paste.
<br />
<br />
My mother and father didn't want me to eat candy. They said candy would rot my teeth out. But eating White Rabbits was a religious experience for me now. There was no turning back.
<br />
<br />
Ye-ye didn't have any teeth. He wore dentures, which he put in a glass beside his bed at night to soak. I saw them floating in the glass free of his mouth when he spent the summers with us in our house in Southern California after my brother, Nathan, was born. Nai-nai had died that spring, and my parents thought Ye-ye would be lonely. I also think they knew he would be willing to look after me for free. My mother was tense and tired and everything I did made her upset. I thought that would eventually change after the baby grew up a little bit, after the crying stopped, or grew less frequent.
<br />
<br />
The moment I woke up, I would sit up in my bed and wait for Ye-ye to come, the second earliest riser. He'd peek into my room, and I'd hold up my arms, and he'd come and pull me out of bed.
<br />
<br />
Ye-ye took me for walks in the ancient stroller. The dew still glistened on the lawns, the air had a faint chill. He'd walk me to the corner and back, all by ourselves. We felt daring in the world.
<br />
<br />
This arrangement continued for years. Ye-ye coming for the summer, my brother taking all my mother's energy.
<br />
<br />
Ye-ye and I only got lost once.
<br />
<br />
By then I was six, and Nathan had an earache. It seemed to last the entire summer. He cried all the time. Mama was irritable. Everything I did made her tense. Same old.
<br />
<br />
We began as we always had. Ye-ye and I walked hand-in-hand up the shaded sidewalks before the sun had risen high enough to burn the dew off and scorch the air. Then we went a little farther than usual, all the way to the corner, and then across that street, and up the block to the big house with gray turrets and large dense fruit trees. The owners were an elderly white couple and they had pomegranates. I'd gone on a field trip for kindergarten and I remembered the way.
<br />
<br />
The nice couple had picked pomegranates from their trees and sliced them open and placed them on picnic tables covered with plastic red-and-white tablecloths. We'd all been given a quarter pomegranate to suck the seeds out of.
<br />
<br />
It was morning and I was hungry, and who knew when my mother would get up and make breakfast anymore.
<br />
<br />
"I know a good place to go," I told Ye-ye, and we set off.
<br />
<br />
But when we got to the corner, I could see the house but it was nothing like the friendly welcoming home of my memory. The tall wrought-iron gates were not tied open with streamers; there were not lines of elementary school children on the lawn with paper plates in their hands. The house was dark, shadowed, the pomegranate trees overgrown, the shade dripping from the eaves and the leaf-laden branches menacing. Even the spiky turrets of the house, which had made it seem castle-like on the field trip, now appeared threatening, as though a witch not a princess might live inside.
<br />
<br />
I froze in place, Ye-ye's warm hand in mine.
<br />
<br />
A bird cawed overhead. Some kind of jay. It flew into the tree, then seemed caught in the sticky darkness. Its cawing turned distressful, a shriek.
<br />
<br />
I squeezed Ye-ye's hand. He patted my head.
<br />
<br />
Ye-ye looked left and right. I knew he was wondering which way to go.
<br />
<br />
At first I couldn't move, then all at once, I knew we needed to run.
<br />
<br />
I pulled Ye-ye's hand and we turned, crossed to the sunny side of the street. I knew there was another way home. A way only in the sunshine.
<br />
<br />
There was a little girl, Karen, whose house I'd gone to for a birthday party. I could picture the house, white with blue shutters, and an orange tree in the lawn, a Big Wheel on the lawn. I felt certain we could reach it. I had walked to the house with Mama pushing Nathan's stroller.
<br />
<br />
We walked another block. Ye-ye followed me, patiently, trusting me.
<br />
<br />
The sun was moving higher in the sky, the shadows retreating, but I didn't feel safe yet from the inky shaded witchy house. We walked and walked. And then I was lost.
<br />
<br />
I knew we should turn. We turned and turned but what should have been our street, our house, our copse of avocado trees, was a different house, one with a chain-link fence and a large German Shepherd with nicked ears staring through the wire. The dog barked, his harsh voice like electric volts to my heart.
<br />
<br />
Ye-ye felt it, and gripped my hand too tightly, it hurt my fingers, and he pulled me along, but he couldn't walk very fast. Still he pulled me alongside him, and I didn't dare say Ouch, until we were out of range of the dog, a block and a turn away. We could hear the echo of his bark, but he was nowhere to be seen, and he surely couldn't see us either, I hoped.
<br />
<br />
We were truly lost then.
<br />
<br />
There was an old white man on a lawn chair in front of one of the houses. He wore shorts and an undershirt and his belly poked out from his shorts. He held a limp hose in one hand. Water trickled from its mouth.
<br />
<br />
There were patches of dirt on his lawn, and dandelions, the kind my father would not tolerate on ours. The moment a single one appeared, Papa would march out with his garden spade and his thick gloves and a plastic trash bag, and he'd dig the dandelion up, all the way to the root, and bag it, and tie the bag, and put it in the trash barrel before it could spread, he said. We were one of only a handful of Chinese families in our town in those days, and Papa felt it was important to show everyone that we understood the rules, that we knew how to keep our lawn nice, that we belonged.
<br />
<br />
The white man stared at us, and Ye-ye hesitated. I knew he was thinking we could ask the man for directions, but I didn't want to. I was afraid of the man. I prayed in my thoughts, Ye-ye, no, we can't stop here. Ever since I was very little, before I could talk, I knew if I thought hard enough, Ye-ye would hear me and understand.
<br />
<br />
No, Ye-ye, I prayed. We can't stop.
<br />
<br />
Ye-ye understood, and we kept walking.
<br />
<br />
The sun was very high overhead, and it was hot. Ye-ye was wearing his long sleeved jacket, and he stopped and took it off, and folded it in half, and half again, and tucked it under his arm.
<br />
<br />
He took my right hand again in his left. My hand was hot and sticky and sweaty, but still he held me tightly.
<br />
<br />
We walked until Ye-ye suddenly had to stop on some stranger's lawn. He led me to a large shade tree, and he leaned his hand against the trunk. He took out his white handkerchief and wiped his face, and neck, and then the top of his head.
<br />
<br />
We were standing on the grass, which white people would not like. I knew from experience when my best friend, Gabby Ocampo, and I ran across the mean neighbor's lawn next to Gabby's house, and the old white woman had run out and shouted, "You brats get off my lawn!"
<br />
<br />
Ye-ye sat down on the lawn and patted the grass so that I would sit next to him. I was afraid we were going to get in trouble; there were white people in the house, looking at us through a crack in the curtains of their front window. I saw them flickering there, the curtains rippling, back and forth. But I obeyed and sat on the grass.
<br />
<br />
Ye-ye reached into his jacket pocket and pulled out a handful of very melted White Rabbits.
<br />
<br />
Ye-ye's eyes twinkled as we both sucked on our candies, resisting the urge to chew, him because it was bad for his dentures, me out of solidarity. Except at the last minute when I absolutely couldn't stand it and I had to chomp on the candy until it was gone.
<br />
<br />
Then like magic, Papa and Mama drove by in our Buick. They were driving slowly, all the windows down, and I saw them, and jumped up and ran towards them.
<br />
<br />
Mama shouted, "Ning-ning, don't run into the street!"
<br />
<br />
And I froze in place.
<br />
<br />
Papa parked the car right there in the middle of the street. He jumped out of the driver's side, and I thought, We are saved!
<br />
<br />
Then he ran over to me, and swatted me on the ass, once, twice, three times. "Bad girl!" he said. And swatted me again.
<br />
<br />
I was too old for this. It wasn't the pain that made me grimace and fight back my tears as I stood there on the sidewalk in front of Ye-ye, in front of the white family who were watching from behind the curtains of their picture window. The indignity.
<br />
<br />
Papa dragged me by the arm to the car. He opened the back door and said, "Get in!" Then he pushed me inside and I sat down, even though the hot vinyl burned the back of my legs.
<br />
<br />
Then Papa went to get Ye-ye, and he helped him up slowly, and he took his arm, and walked him to the other side of the car.
<br />
<br />
Mama said, "Poor Ye-ye. Oh, poor Ye-ye. He could have had a stroke in this heat." Nathan was on her lap and he started to whimper.
<br />
<br />
Ye-ye said something to Papa in Chinese that I couldn't understand and Papa said something in Chinese back, only very loudly, and over and over.
<br />
<br />
Then Mama said, "Ning-ning, what were you thinking?"
<br />
<br />
That's how it was, ever since Nathan was born. I was blamed for everything that went wrong. His illness, his crying all the time, his having to go to the hospital, all the tests, all the doctors.
<br />
<br />
"Ning-ning, I'm ashamed of you. You know you're not supposed to leave the house alone. What has gotten into you?"
<br />
<br />
And I thought like saying, But I wasn't alone. I was with Ye-ye. But I didn't say it. Which turned out to be a good thing, because the next thing Mama said was, "You could have gotten Ye-ye killed. You're lucky we found you."
<br />
<br />
And that's when I cried for real, tears and snot and shame, in front of everyone.
<br />
<br />
After that, my parents became fearful. I wasn't allowed to go out by myself, and I wasn't allowed to go on walks with Ye-ye.
<br />
<br />
"He's forgetful. He's not himself. You're too much for him."
<br />
<br />
The next year, Ye-ye didn't come for the summer at all. He stayed in his apartment in New York City with my uncle. In fact, he wouldn't visit again in person ever. Traveling had become too hard for him.
<br />
<br />
However, he continued to send me White Rabbits in a box for my birthday and New Year's, along with a red envelope, every year until he died when I was eleven.
<br />
<br />
I didn't have White Rabbits again until I went to China on a study abroad trip my junior year of college.
<br />
<br />
In advance of Spring Festival, the street stalls were suddenly full of bins and bins of White Rabbit candies. Walking the streets around the campus of Nanjing University, I was thrilled to see the candy of my youth. I immediately bought a bag full and brought them back to the dorm.
<br />
<br />
I passed them around to everyone I met. "I loved these when I was a child," I explained.
<br />
<br />
The old man who sat in the guardhouse at the gate politely took a handful but the women who worked in the building merely shook their heads and laughed uncomfortably.
<br />
<br />
My Chinese roommate looked on in horror. "My grandmother liked those," she said.
<br />
<br />
I knew I was a disappointment to her. This whole mixed-nationality roommate situation was an experiment on campus, a sign of China's emergence from decades of seclusion, and was supposed to be an honor. My roommate had signed up and gone through some kind of rigorous screening process. She had been promised an American, and she'd expected some chic, blonde white girl with exotic ways and instead she got me, a Chinese American with cheap taste.
<br />
<br />
Back in our room she pulled out a Toblerone roll from the drawer of her desk and popped a piece in her mouth to make her point.
<br />
<br />
After that I kept my fetish to myself. But every morning when I woke, the loudspeaker outside our window blaring music for the morning exercises that my roommate and I refused to rise for, I reached from the cocoon of my comforter into the frosty air of our unheated dorm room, and pulled a new White Rabbit from the bag I kept on my desk.
