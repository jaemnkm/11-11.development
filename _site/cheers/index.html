cloud forest and not a single one of you since. Decomposed? You lived underground, you

came
<br />
up once a year to to mate— in piggybacks and puddles. Smooth orange skin, halfway
<br />
translucent. Sunny D poured into a mold. Indiscriminate acts to hurtle your species into the future.
<br />
Possible
<br />
to foil this extinction through propagation? No, the population’s the problem. Too many humans. 
<br />
Still
<br />
not likely to go quietly— Brenda says it’s <i>relaxation time</i>— but not like that, not long now.
<br />
Be
<br />
the carbon and the green. No one there to identify their bones at the scene. Just no one there at all 
<br />

sun, moon, woolly mammoth, and the moon’s moons, and probably roaches, rats, pigeons, and squirrels.
