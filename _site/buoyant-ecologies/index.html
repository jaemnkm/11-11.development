<meta name="description" content="The ECOPOESIS Movement: Collaborative Messaging and Making Towards Equality Ecologies It is a grey winter day in San Francisco as we write this. The pounding seasonal rains that march in from the Pacific, parking in place sometimes for days, are a welcome and sharp contrast to a month earlier when we wore our N95 masks while vast stretches burned to the north and the south. We see it is our new experience of autumn in California, these terrifying, lethal fires. All that smoke. The enforced black outs as they power down the grid to keep lines from setting things alight. It is easy to fall into narratives of ecologies that point towards climate chaos and all of its complex peril? These stories create a psychic stress and can lead to voidance, feelings of depression, end-of-days talk. We need a new narrative for the new epoch. It was this instinct that drove Ecopoesis founders Leslie Carol Roberts, Adam Marcus, and Chris Falliers to think about how we need to advocate for new logics of life on earth, for all, humans and nonhumans. With more to read each day about the effects of climate chaos on our collective psyche, the Ecopoesis Movement advocates for looking at this with a shared, gentle courage, for writing with power and precision, for using our human creative powers to design the next world. It has to start somewhere and so we started by doing what we love most: Gathering over a meal and sharing thoughts and feelings about what the world to come needs from us today. We are not a solutionizing movement nor are we against solutionizing. We are an ecological town square, a place to gather and ponder thoughts. The Ecopoesis Movement advocates for looking with care at how humans can collaborate more democratically with nonhumans. We have been very bad about this, very reckless. Let’s look at how we have used human communication to signal our disinterest in equality ecologies. We created categories for nonhumans, large buckets such as Nature and The Environment. When we are in Nature, we are not stoking our little fires. In contemporary times, these retreats to Nature have been urged on us as a way to halt the distraction of screens – with their own horrific fires in the form of the cloud and server farms. We might even refer to our small screens, clutched in hand, as a cold fire. We created many small pails and files and teaspoons of differentiation in how we talked about Nature and the Environment across disciplines. There is positive movement, of course, towards interdisciplinary work, towards an art and design of the Anthropocene that seriously or playfully prods us to shift our thoughts. We feel that many days few choices or opportunities are offered to create conversations, dialogues, reflections on how it feels to live in a world literally and metaphorically on fire.
