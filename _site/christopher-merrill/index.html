<p>What am I thinking about? I’m thinking about the lecture I will give to twenty Russian professors here at Yasnaya Polyana, Tolstoy’s country estate, some details of which I worked out on a long walk in the fields and woods that inspired <em>War and Peace</em> and <em>Anna Karenina</em>, and then I will turn my attention to the shape of my next book, <em>The Trials of Roger Williams</em>, a biography of my first ancestor in the New World. Which is to say: I’m at once excited and quite anxious.</p>
