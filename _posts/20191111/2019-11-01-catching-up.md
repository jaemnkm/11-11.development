<span style="font-weight:700;padding-left: 50px;">Q: You started 11.11 when you were CCA MFA graduate students. What was the particular motivation? </span>

GR: Youmna and I clicked when we first met at CCA, especially during the MFA dinner at the Headlands Center for the Arts. We walked and talked that day at the Headlands about the magazines and literary journals that moved us, what moments created writers, and global moments and art. I think we each had our own and shared motivations and inspirations. I do know one major motivation was to create a beautiful, visually striking and thought provoking physical representation (and marketing tool) of the amazing art, design and writing that was happening at CCA. At the time, the CCA MFA, Writing program was in its second year and the Wattis Institute for Contemporary Arts was just named and there wasn’t a journal that represented the writing and artist community. So we decided to dream it, create it and wrote the proposal for it in 2003.  It was a perfect beginning, a new chapter for so much change at CCA and for both of us young women. Eleven Eleven 11.11 was also created during the early years of the US War in Afghanistan, a few years after 9/11. Freedom, community, and the role of art and artists was a major issue for me as a young artist. I was very much influenced by theater, the theater of war, the visuals of walking inside an art school everyday, having the perspective of being a woman of color and knowing that our country was in the middle of a war that my brother as an Army Specialist was fighting in Afghanistan. What was the change I wanted to see in art, in writing and being an engaged part of my community? I think that was poured into the first issue of Eleven Eleven 11.11 - inspiration and creation to continue despite real physical (world, national, local, familial) and emotional turmoil.

<span style="font-weight:700;padding-left: 50px;">Q: Each of you have gone on to really beautiful careers. Younma, can you talk about how your installation and other art work is in conversation with your writing? And Gayle -- you have founded a publishing house, where you write and publish works about Filipino history. How did founding 11.11 inform your work on Bridge + Delta?</span>
 
 
GR: I have always been a part of production work since high school, undergraduate years, and then at CCA. But CCA was a real test about ideas moving to a larger community that wasn’t predominantly Filipino or People of Color focused. It was an elite art space that a young woman of color like me was able to get a seat at. It was an arena of professional artists from around the world. If they thought that something I created was good enough to invest in, then I could create content at an even larger scale. Eleven Eleven 11.11 definitely propelled me to create content and the confidence to pull my seat at the table of decision making or create my own table and chairs, make my own space and invite others to sit and collaborate with me. Eleven Eleven 11.11 was a wonderful example of “If you build it, they will come.” As an artist, I don’t necessarily think that applies every time. But I have been lucky to have examples like this in my artist career. It also shows the longevity of the written word and the strong community of artists and writers who keep it sustainable. I’m grateful for these experiences, because that’s what inspires me and keeps me going when doubt and an unknown future is in front of me. As a writer and artist, the unknown is always there. Especially since writing is how I feed my family. I hold these wins close and remind myself that dreaming, creating, sustaining is my job and always has been.

<span style="font-weight:700;padding-left: 50px;">Q: You each have books out. Can we talk about your books?</span>
 
GR:  "Journey for Justice: The Life of Larry Itiong" is the first book about the largely unknown Filipino co-founder of the United Farm Workers Larry Itliong. Larry Itliong was an immigrant and worked the fields. He became a labor organizer and was a community leader when the Filipinos began the Delano Grape Strike on September 8, 1965. One week after starting the grape strike, Itliong called Cesar Chavez and asked the Mexicans to join the Delano Grape Strike. After five long years of the strike, the farm workers were able to negotiate their contracts with growers. This movement became a global movement, propelling Cesar Chavez in the limelight. The UFW was famously created during the Delano Grape Strike, with Cesar Chavez as director and Larry Itliong as assistant director. 
 
Former Governor Brown signed into law that October 25 is Larry Itliong Day and a day for all California public school students to celebrate. However, there wasn’t a book about Larry ever written. So I called one of my dearest friends, renowned Stanford trained Filipino American historian Dr. Dawn Mabalon. We wrote the book together based off of her research. On the day we finished the book, Dawn passed away. I was actually with Youmna on that day. And that was devastating. But I have been on an intense national book tour. We launched the book at the San Francisco Museum of Fine Art to a standing room only crowd in 2018. I was just recently featured in the New York Times about the book and there are still six more stops in a 21 city national book tour. It’s a dense book, for children ages 10 and up. It’s currently being taught at schools and school districts throughout the country, and in universities such as UCLA, San Francisco State University, University of Michigan, Rice University, and more in the spring.I am grateful for all of it, because books like this don’t come easy. But this book has shown me that sometimes the universe leads you in a creative direction that you never saw coming, but makes so much sense in hindsight. All the late nights and work, all for this book and for these moments. For more information and the free teaching guide visit www.bridgedelta.com.

<span style="font-weight:700;padding-left: 50px;">Q: There's a lot going on in publishing these days -- what are you reading or excited about?</span>
 
GR: It’s very rare for me to get a chance to sit down and read a full book cover to cover in one sitting. With four kids, I either listen on audiobooks or read days or months at a time, several books. Right now, I have been enjoying reading (and rereading) Filipino American poet and Guggenheim fellow Patrick Rosal’s book, "Brooklyn Antediluvian." It won the Academy of American Poets Lenore Marshall Prize for best book of poetry. He’s an honest to goodness real and authentic person and poet, he also does fantastic readings of his work on poets.org. I am also rereading the Pulitzer Prize winning play, "Top Dog Under Dog" by Suzan-Lori Parks (I lost my first copy from a decade ago so I ordered it and read it again recently). I also read Phil Knight’s memoir (creator of Nike), "Shoe Dogs.” It was a completely indulgent read. I could have read it all in one sitting, had I not been interrupted by my kiddos. If you have a dream to create and bring it to a larger audience, Phil Knight’s memoir is mandatory.

<span style="font-weight:700;padding-left: 50px;">Q: Any pro-tips for humans who want to start literary magazines and communities?</span>
 
GR: I think you just have to ask and see where it takes you. Asking can mean asking for funding, asking for time off from a job, so you can create, or asking yourself, is this worth it? Don’t have any shame in what you create. Own it, even if it doesn’t turn out the way you expected. Sustainability is definitely something to keep in mind down the road. But for now, do research on 21st century production, the information is out there online and accessible, find a VERY good editor (no one likes typos) and a good partner (this person can be the same person if you’re lucky). Trust me, you’ll need that friend or partner when you run into unforeseeable problems or need help doing marketing/PR. No one is an island, and nothing is ever created in a vacuum. Find your tribe!
