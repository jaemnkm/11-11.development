<br>

<br><br>
For my entire adult life I have tried to live in coastal cities while also making art, which is an expensive thing to do, and so I have, on several occasions, attempted to look beyond the land on which a city sits, to the ocean that surrounds it, for a more affordable place to call home. I was most serious about living on the ocean in 2011. I was living in Brooklyn, on the Red Hook border, right next to the BQE. I would go on long walks to that tip of the island and look at the boat slips that looked onto to the Statue of Liberty. I would look at the sailboats docked in the boat slips and think, perhaps that could be my life? I get seasick easily, which I consider a shameful Achilles heel. If I were a comic book character I would be defeated by my foe in a hand-to-hand combat fight at sea. People say you get over being seasick. I got a formal quote to rent a Red Hook boat slip and began to obsessively hunt for a boat on Craigslist.
<br><br>
Prior to living in New York, I lived in Providence, Rhode Island. In Providence, there was one pair of artists, who were friends of friends, that lived off the coast on a vessel made entirely out of trash. I never visited the vessel, but I heard a great deal about it, and the newspaper I illustrated for published a long form journalism piece about it. It wasn’t a boat. It was more of a floating house. The residents of the vessel had a pet raven named Always Less, an ode to their minimalist, ecological way of life and a crack at Poe’s “never more.” I heard that Always Less acted more like a dog and less like a raven. I can’t find any record of the article about the vessel online. I don’t know how long the pair of artists lived with Always Less on the Providence coastline. Perhaps they are still there.
<br><br>
The first time I saw the Buoyant Ecologies Float Lab I thought, maybe artists and teachers could live in there? In 2007 in Providence, Rhode Island I would have lived in one, and in 2011 in New York City I would have lived in one, and in 2019, in San Francisco, in the now of my life, I would live in one. Can you imagine? Out by Baker Beach! In the Oakland Shipyard! It would be a glorious constellation of kidney-shaped homes. The float labs look womb-like and warm to me. Their organic shape and topographic surface makes them look like they’re the cousins of a modern art gallery, which is exactly the kind of place I’d love to call home.
<br><br>
I often think of just how paltry the condo design is in this city. Surely, I think, it could not be that much more expensive to make a building, that is already being built from scratch, look remotely nice? Here in San Francisco the condos are plagued by cheap, shiny or stucco exterior materials and a stacked-blocks shape. Often, the blocks are staggered, so that one row of blocks faces out in the opposite direction of another, the result being what looks like a shoddy, rectangular Rubik’s cube mid-turn. The condos look horrible to live in. There is nothing remotely creative or beautiful or bohemian or affordable about a new San Francisco condominium. I want there to be more housing because we need more places for people to live, but surely we can make more places for people to live that don’t look so temporary? San Francisco condos look disposable, like the building version of a take out container that is non-compostable.  
<br><br>
I’m trying to figure out: do the condos look temporary because they are block shaped? Do organic shapes, like the Buoyant Ecologies kidneys, look like they will last longer because they look like nature? What inside my animal brain makes me think that I, a land-living human plagued by seasickness, am much more likely to survive in a windowless house boat come laboratory shaped like a kidney than a block-shaped condominium?
<br><br>
I never did buy the boat in Brooklyn. I didn’t have enough cash. Like everybody else, I paid rent for a room in a shared apartment on land.
<br><br>
Here, in San Francisco, houseboat communities are glamorous and established. When I drive over the Golden Gate Bridge I look at the Sausalito houseboats lustily. I think what most attracts me to living on them is the thought of waking up next to that beautiful flat expanse of water. There is something about being so near water, that necessary absence of anything, that makes it feel like it is easier to think.
<br><br>
If I were to sleep inside one of the float lab’s warm kidneys I imagine it would feel like I had the whole ocean to dream in. I have a gut feeling that it will be easy for me to overcome seasickness inside them. Perhaps the first inhabitable float lab could be an artist residency. I would love to see the potent work produced by whoever is sleeping so close to the ecologies of the sea.
