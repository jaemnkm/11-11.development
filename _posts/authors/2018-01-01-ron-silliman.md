Ron Silliman has written and edited 40 books and had his poetry and criticism translated into 16 languages. Silliman was a 2012 Kelly Writers House Fellow at the University of Pennsylvania, and the 2010 recipient of the Levinson Prize from the Poetry Foundation. His sculpture _Poetry (Bury Neon)_ is permanently on display in the transit center of Bury, Lancashire, and he has a plaque in the walk dedicated to poetry in his home town of Berkeley. Silliman teaches at the University of Pennsylvania and is married to a former student of CCA. The former editor of _The Socialist Review_, and a member of the Democratic Socialists of America dating back to 1982, he is an obsessive on the subject of writing poetry, not poems, and thinks that the craft approach to art is essential to the issues facing everyone in the age of late capital.
