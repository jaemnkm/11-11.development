<br><br>
In my first rented room in San Francisco, the grey sky flooded the grey carpet through a bay window. The corded phone snaked its tether between two cardboard book boxes and a frameless twin futon that moved every night while I slept, crawled across the empty space, pushed by my dreams, until I woke and dragged it back again.
<br>
<br>
I’d just slept with a woman for the first time. I’d slept with her and then had moved five hundred miles north. This meant something. I didn’t know what. After I moved, she sent a card. She wrote, *I will always remember*. She seemed far away. I didn’t write back. I wanted to live in the briefest impression. I didn’t want to disrupt the image of myself I’d read in the card with this new one of me, alone in a blank room.
<br>
<br>
The room was in the Richmond District, out on 11th Avenue. I’d found it advertised on an actual flyer, tacked into the actual cork of an actual bulletin board on the wall of the student center at San Francisco State University. It was August of 2000, and everyone said there was nowhere affordable to live. Students who couldn’t get into dorms were sleeping in hostels. The end-of-the-century startups were just beginning to fail.
<br>
<br>
I answered the corkboard ad and I went for the interview and the woman whose parents owned the house asked me if I was a lesbian.
<br>
<br>
“Nothing against them,” she said. “I just don’t want to live with one.”
<br>
<br>
I didn’t know if I was lying when I answered no. I knew I needed to live somewhere. I thought she was asking a price I could afford.
<br>
<br>
I didn’t know how to dress for the San Francisco air that chilled in a block or an hour, wind and fog that crept suddenly, obliterating the September sun and pulling at my skin. I didn’t know how to carry all the things with me that I would need in a day. I was always hungry. I was always thirsty. I was always cold. I always had to pee. I had no armor. Some days, I thought I had no skin. I didn’t know how to make friends; instead I made dates.
<br>
<br>
I went anywhere with anyone who asked me, and the people who asked me were all boys or men I met in a class, at the bus stop, while at parties I’d been invited to by other boys or men. I walked with them, miles through the city at 10pm, up one hundred steps to Coit Tower and down the hill to hear the sea lions on Embarcadero, fat and lazy and loud and shining in the dark. I ate foods I’d never heard of in restaurants with men who worked there as waiters—crepes, shiso, fermented bean sauce, something lit on fire beside the table. I took long bus rides and got drunk in their apartments in the Mission and the Presidio. I kissed them even when I knew that they were cruel or boring or rude. I lifted my shirt in the front seat of a pickup truck and breathed in the soft clay hair smell of one man’s dreads even as he told me he wasn’t dating white women anymore, that he definitely wouldn’t call me again. I took home the blue rose bought for me by a man with straight white teeth who softly criticized my bleached hair and chipped fingernails during dinner, who said “I never date women like you,” and who fed me my first ever taste of risotto. I kept the rose in a vase on the windowsill until it died, then I hung it upside down on the empty wall, then I threw it away. I spent hours and nights on the dirty sheets of boys in dirty clothes, boys who used candles rather than pay the electric bill, who gave me vodka and Orange Crush and whose rough tongues chapped my face. I mapped my body with their hands. I walked home up 19th Avenue at 7am, spent enough not to ask myself who exactly I thought I was.
<br>
<br>
Alone and hungry again in the afternoon, I walked forever down Irving Street into the grey and greyer avenues toward the ocean, sky turning, fog rising through October and into November, walked back past windows displaying French fries and bubble-tea and donuts and mop heads, pink plastic sets of pens, toothbrush holders printed with bright cartoons, walked past children and couples and old men sweeping their shop-fronts.  I yearned to buy things, thought that buying things would give me a place on the street, a reason for being here. Buying something would ease the feeling that I belonged nowhere. But I had no money, and when I wandered back up 19th Avenue and into the rose garden, I held only a small paper cup of coffee. The coffee cost a dollar fifty, and even as I bought it, I criticized myself for spending the six quarters.
<br>
<br>
Golden Gate Park broke in front of me, the rose garden wide and thorned, secret behind a wall of trees, bare of roses in November and suddenly hushed after the rushing traffic. The bushes were deep waxy green, waiting for the dirt to warm. A plastic photo was speared into the ground beneath each plant, pixilated, promising blooms.
<br>
<br>
It was 2001 when I moved out of the house on 11th Avenue and when I slept with a woman again. Theresa was a redheaded dance major at City College. One Saturday she suggested we rouge our nipples and go out in the Castro topless to dance upstairs at The Cafe where they never turned away our fake IDs. If we could only brave the cold bay wind, we could be anything. Another Saturday she sat beside me on my futon and read my poems, her hair big with curls, heavy with honey pomade. She sat silently reading, and then she looked up at me, her eyes clear, and there was not a moment when this did not feel temporary.
<br>
<br>
Every time I went to her house she took off her shirt.
<br>
<br>
“I don’t usually date women like you,” she said, and when we finally went to bed together, I touched her clumsily, hoped I could make her feel something.
<br>
<br>
I cut off my hair, bought big jeans that sagged on my hips, tried for soft butch but had no language to describe what I was doing. Everyone I knew was simply gay or not gay. I’d slept with too many men. I loved lace bras and lipstick. I was not anything; I was only a series of actions.
<br>
<br>
On my twenty-first birthday I lived in an apartment on 48th Avenue, last stop on the N train, an hour from downtown. I had a party. I had a tight, second-hand skirt that split to the waist as I danced. I didn’t care. I got drunker, apartment full of people laughing and flirting and clutching tallboys in damp brown bags. At some point I sat on the carpet with my skirt at my waist and tied on my roller skates. Someone danced above me. Someone touched my arm. Someone asked where I was going.
<br>
<br>
I flew in circles in the middle of the street with the night against my face. A hard dash across the Pacific Coast Highway and down the concrete beach steps and then I sunk into the sand, grains in the wheels, fell into it cold and rough, sky a flat black milk, hush, hush, hush of the invisible tide and the fog that was both real and not real, its hands laid on me, everything a soft blank thrill.
<br>
<br>
That night I’d pinned gardenias in my hair, sold by an old woman with a flower stand on Market and 6th, out in front of a place named simply Donuts and Chinese Food. She kept the gardenias floating in a bucket of water, her hands always moving. She’d sell you one with a pearl-topped pin for a dollar. I bought them to smell something sweet all night and into the morning, petals turning brown on the nightstand. That flower stand now is an empty wooden box on the sidewalk. The donut shop is also gone. Nothing looks like it did.
<br>
<br>
In December, 2002, I laid beside Vanessa, who was shy and Armenian and from Bakersfield, our legs over each other’s legs and her breasts against my arm. Her green eyes took up half her face. This was the only time we slept together, in the middle of the afternoon, on top of the quilt. We had not even taken off all our clothes. I told her what I was doing for money–that I had answered some ads, that I took off my clothes, that I let men tie me up. I was testing her. I didn’t know who I could tell.
<br>
<br>
“How much money?” she asked. She was smart. I knew I wouldn’t call her again.
<br>
<br>
The ads were in the back pages of the *Weekly* and the *Guardian*, beside black and white photos of women in underpants whose faces you couldn’t see. *Models wanted: 18 and over. Must be height-weight proportional. Make up to $1000 a day. No experience necessary.* I called the phone numbers and spoke to the men on the other end and tried to tell from their voices whether they could hurt me. I sifted the dollar bins on Mission Street for handfuls of black lace thongs and white cotton panties. I invested thirty-five precious dollars in a pair of shining black patent fetish stilettoes. I took trains and busses to apartments and warehouses in Livermore and Hayward and Sacramento and San Jose. I put on my lace thongs and my high heeled shoes and then I took them off slowly while the men who owned new digital cameras snapped the shutter that was no longer an actual shutter—the click, click, click, click only a replica of the mechanical processes these new cameras had already begun to render obsolete.
<br>
<br>
I spread my legs and got paid more. I bought a candy-colored dildo and got paid more. I let the men talk dirty to me and I negotiated how much they were allowed to touch me and I got paid more. I answered their ill-written ads and talked vaguely with my friends about what could get you arrested and what couldn’t. I put the dildo in my vagina and then in my mouth and I leaned back and thrust my chest out and closed my eyes and then opened them again. I touched my breasts, pretended to lick my own nipples, opened my eyes and looked directly into the lens. The camera clicked its false shutter.
<br>
<br>
The men who hired me were white and middle aged. They were single or they were just-divorced. Or they were young, barely older than me, and they had money to spend. There would always be three or four of the young men together. One had the money, one had the camera, two others were just there, leaning in from the edge of the room. They’d say “have you heard of Suicide Girls? We’re like Suicide Girls but edgier.” They’d say, “We’re studying business.” They’d say, “This is our class project.”
<br>
<br>
The older men covered their sofas with red velvet. They brought in props: a schoolgirl dress, a chalky blackboard. They asked about my plans for Christmas and how school was going. I had dropped out of school, but I lied to make them feel as though the money they paid me was going toward some worthwhile improvement of my circumstances. These lies made them smile and nod and offer me rides home, which I took.
<br>
<br>
The younger men gestured toward small, cleared spots in their unmade beds and their unclean kitchens. Towels and clothes on the floor, dishes stacked in the sink. “Just do what you feel like doing,” they said.
<br>
<br>
I never did what I felt like doing.
<br>
<br>
I laid on their linoleum floors and put my wet fists in my mouth. I lubed up the wood handles of their kitchen knives. I put the knives inside me and I held my breath and I told them to shoot. Later, they sent me emails and discs of the photos they’d taken, and I opened the images and then closed them, critiquing the pale vulnerability of my own face.
<br>
<br>
When I had no ride, I took the bus and the train home again at three or seven or midnight, past the darkening green meridians of Palo Alto, past the stacked red boxcars at West Oakland BART. I kept one hand inside my backpack, touching my new stack of cash.
<br>
<br>
That same year, the year of Vanessa and the knives, I answered the ad to work at the company that would later be named Kink.com, but they weren’t called that yet. They were named Cybernet Entertainment–a beginning-of-the-internet name–and they were housed in a warehouse on 8th Street. On 8th Street in 2002 there were no condos, no restaurants, no organic grocery stores with jewel-box displays of grass-fed beef. The street was quiet and studded with men and women sleeping or drinking in doorways. I knocked on the door beneath the address I’d written down, my lipstick and eyelashes already on. There was a concrete floor and a brick wall and the smell of soldered iron. I walked in and shook someone’s hand and took off my clothes. Someone tied me up and spanked me and then untied me and put me in the freshly soldered metal cuffs and rolled the camera. The camera man said, “rolling,” even though there was nothing, no part of the machine that actually rolled any more. Every way they touched me, I made a sound and moved against it. I moaned and clenched my fists. I gave them my best show. Afterward, I had enough to cover my entire month’s rent, held it right there in my hand.
<br>
<br>
On 14th Street, the year was 2004. I was twenty-three. I didn’t know if what I was doing was bad. I was trying to balance it all, to keep my secrets, to make it make sense in my head. It was a thing that still seemed possible then—keeping secrets. In four years, I had shot a hundred, two hundred hours of footage. With a credit card you could see every visible part of me. You could watch me whisper and sweat. You could watch me scream. I knew this meant something. I didn’t know what.
<br>
<br>
I was in love with Francesca. We lived together. She was beautiful and brilliant and hard. In self-portraits for her photo class, she reached forward in low light, about to touch something just out of frame. She could paint exact copies of impressionist masters and make jokes you never saw coming. We were best friends and she was straight. I still had no words for what I was. Our apartment was on 14th and South Van Ness, beside a garage that seeped fumes day and night. We went out nights and picked up men and went to their apartments in Nob Hill or Soma and left together early the next morning, our skin dry and tight from no sleep. Or we stayed home and drank white wine from the FoodsCo down the block and drew all night on sheets of newsprint, charcoal dust and pencil shavings sticking to our bare feet and going up our noses until all our exhales were black graphite and we laughed at each other’s streaked faces.
<br>
<br>
At 3am, we made capes, put on neon shorts and corsets, declared ourselves the Action Adventure Club and swore we’d climb the jagged brick walls of the massive, abandoned armory two blocks away. We laughed louder, added headbands and face paint, picked up plastic swords and swung them at each other and drank more. The broken armory windows were ten or fifteen feet off the ground. We were numb with booze. We believed, holding swords, in our own beauty. We were certain our bodies could get us over fifteen feet of brick.
<br>
<br>
“What do you think is inside?” Frenchie asked, and her eyes glowed, black hair a wild halo.
<br>
<br>
We drank until our faces were numb and talked all night about the adventures we’d have and never left the apartment. At five or six we laid costumed in her bed under the long pink curtains and open window, the neighbor’s Mexican pop and cigarette smoke coming up through the airshaft.
<br>
<br>
She said, “You are the only one who understands me,” and I believed her. There was no world, there was only us.
<br>
<br>
I was twenty-four when I got my first actual girlfriend. When I learned the words “queer femme”—learned that there were names people had given to the things I felt. I was renting a room on 23rd and Florida, and more than once that year people were shot on my block; a friend was stabbed; my apartment building caught fire and I went out in the street in my pajamas, holding my pawn-shop violin, standing in a crowd of my neighbors watching the smoke rise and the uniformed men rush up the stairs. When we were let back into the building, watery-grey stains covered our walls and the apartment above us was a black shell, but everything else—one hundred books—had been saved.
<br>
<br>
On weekends, Ashley came to pick me up on her motorcycle and the dealer, Smiley, who stood on our corner, shouted, “What’s she got that I don’t?”
<br>
<br>
I liked Smiley, liked the rhythm of his voice beneath my window while I wrote poems.
<br>
<br>
“Alright keep it moving keep it moving don’t let the block get hot.”
<br>
<br>
I liked that he kept people from using on our street, told them to take it elsewhere. I liked that he knew me. Said hello, smiled when I was walking home. I liked him even though I had just broken up with a man I’d loved who nodded off at dinner parties, who sat on the floor of his room Christmas morning surrounded by clipped bits of paper, his eyes red and wet, jaw loose and speech slurred saying, “don’t worry baby we’re gonna have a great Christmas.” Every day I feared I’d get the call that he was dead. I didn’t blame Smiley for this.
<br>
<br>
“What’s she got that I don’t?” Smiley asked, and I laughed, all of it part of the show. I felt free and easy climbing onto the back of Ashley’s motorcycle, deep purple Japanese plum trees vibrant against a rare blue sky, sun on us, engine starting, bare legged and daring the concrete to rise up.
<br>
<br>
We’d end up at the Lexington Club–the Lex–packed into a hot crowd of queers. Finally, I was in the room. Finally, I had a small piece of the language. Finally, I’d begun to move into my orbit, my own limbs and face and tits finally making sense as they moved in response to the muscle and sweat of all the other dykes and femmes, bois and butches and trans men and women who were doing nothing complicated and everything complicated, standing and talking or not talking, just looking at each other and drinking four-dollar pints.
<br>
<br>
Ashley would lean into the bar and order us drinks. One night, she shouted to the bartender, “My girlfriend’s a porn star.” I was too startled to hear the response.
<br>
<br>
One night in her bed, naked and damp, she asked me, if she were to pay me, how much the sex we’d just had would have cost.
<br>
<br>
“I usually date women like you,” she told me.
<br>
<br>
It was during that year that I saw Theresa again, I was pressing through the crowd in the Lex when a stranger, a big woman in a leather vest appeared in front of me.
<br>
<br>
“I know you,” she said, “You fucked my girlfriend.” She was tougher and butcher than I’d ever pretended to be. I froze. Her face was stoic and then slowly she cracked a smile and then Theresa was there beside her, lithe and also smiling and her face was still a kind of invitation I couldn’t answer, and I smiled back at them and moved on. Later, I heard they were married. I wondered what Theresa could have said about me to her soon-to-be wife and why she had said it. I wondered which of the things that people said had anything to do with me.
<br>
<br>
When Ashley dumped me, in a Thai restaurant on Valencia Street, she told me I had no “queer indicators.”
<br>
<br>
“It’s going to be hard for you,” she said, “to meet other women.”
<br>
<br>
I was twenty-four still, in the Community Room of Saint James Infirmary at 10th and Mission in 2005. The women and a few men who gathered there every Wednesday night talked about their jobs and got acupuncture, picked up donated food and waited for a coveted appointment with the only doctor most of us had access to. The students from the acupuncture school stuck needles in our ears and I was too tired and scared to talk, but there was a tall, fine-boned woman who always smiled at me and asked how I was.
<br>
<br>
She’d say, “How you doing beautiful?” and something in her voice or face made beautiful feel solid. Like currency. A thing I could own. There were a lot of people in the Community Room she smiled at. Her name, I learned, was Sequoia, and she made you feel like there was beauty to go around.
<br>
<br>
I went to St. James every week that year, just to be in a room with other people like me. I went through the intake, filled out the anonymous paperwork and sat quietly in a folding chair between the canned-food table and the bookshelf, reading the donated paperbacks. Sequoia walked in, said, “Hey girl,” and I flushed with pleasure.
<br>
<br>
One night she grabbed a pastel polyester tank-top from the rack of free clothing and she thrust it toward me.
<br>
<br>
“This is exactly you,” she said. “Girl someone gave this up for your little body.”
<br>
<br>
I took the shirt home. It was pink and ruched. Too small, but I kept it anyway. I hung it in my closet and took it out and held it against my chest and thought of Sequoia’s beautiful, how utterly different it was from what the photographers said, from what men hollered in the street.
<br>
<br>
I think of Sequoia every time I walk down 6th Street, where we used to pass each other, me walking to a shoot, her already working. She never once looked past me, though she was busy and scanning the block. She was over six feet tall in heels, straight black hair to the middle of her back, cheekbones high and shining. You could not help but look at her. She smiled so big, so soft and easy that it felt like we were somewhere else. Like all the neon on the block bent to the shape of our names.
<br>
<br>
“Hey beautiful,” she waved, and I waved back, trying to make my face as open and generous as hers.
<br>
<br>
At least half of the sex workers I knew in San Francisco had worked at the Lusty. They were working there now or they had worked there before or they were about to start or they were about to go back.
<br>
<br>
I was twenty-six when I went there to apply. I’d just returned from a year of working in Los Angeles. My skin was tired. I didn’t want to be touched. I was certain that the things I’d done for money had marked me permanently, that the world would not forgive me, even if I wanted forgiveness. I did not yet know whether I wanted forgiveness. Some days I ached for it. Some days I just thought everyone could burn.
<br>
<br>
I had no college degree. I had almost no experience doing anything clothed for money. The Lusty seemed like a safe place. I liked the idea of being behind glass.
<br>
<br>
I walked down Market and up Kearney, past the Chinatown produce markets, the North Beach sidewalk tables laid with jars of salt and oil. Old women filled their pushcarts with rutabaga and roast duck.
<br>
<br>
Inside the Lusty the afternoon was gone, a young woman in a black bra, red lipstick, and a rainbow feather boa said, “Go put a dollar in. See if it looks like something you can do. If yes, I’ll give you an application.”
<br>
<br>
I felt in my pockets.
<br>
<br>
“Do you have a dollar?”
<br>
<br>
I pulled out a folded bill, gave her my best smile.
<br>
<br>
I walked toward the back, went into a booth and gave my money to the slot. The window slid up, revealing three bodies arched away from me, toward someone in another window. This tableau–-of curves and heels onto which you could project any dream, the dream of imaginary creatures who might live always naked and soft and waiting for you in a carpeted box—lasted less than a second before the woman nearest me transformed into someone specific. Someone I’d met before at St. James or at the Lex or at some queer party. She crawled down the little catwalk, her breasts swaying between her arms, a feathered pin in her hair, not really seeing me, redirecting her show toward my window.
<br>
<br>
“Hey there, what do you like to watch?” she said, and then, one inch closer, she grinned. “I know you,” she said, and I nodded and laughed. “What’s your name again?” she asked, but even as she began to speak the window was closing. I didn’t have another dollar. I went back to the woman at the front and took the piece of paper she gave me up to Washington Square and sat with it in the grass, scrawling all my false names in the blank space, beneath the white plaster facade of St Patrick’s Church.
<br>
<br>
Within the week I was already working two other jobs: spanking men of all shapes during day shift at an Oakland dungeon, dancing bachelor parties on a boat on Friday and Saturday nights. I never turned the application in, but I held onto it.
<br>
<br>
The Lusty, the Lex, St. James. These lived always in my mind. Kearney and Broadway, 19th and Lexington, Mission and 10th. A map of places I could go if I needed to.
<br>
<br>
Sequoia was killed in 2006. She was stabbed one night by a client in the park.
<br>
<br>
At St. James, there was a memorial service with candles and photos. I’d been in LA, working. I’d missed the memorial. I didn’t even know it had happened until I came back and saw her photos taped up on the wall, saw the votives burned to black stubs.
<br>
<br>
I was angry. I was sad and I was pissed off, and I could not find her name in the newspaper, seemed as though her name was nowhere except in that room. She was gone, cut down, and I’d failed to give her back even a second of what she had given to me. I’d failed to even tell her what that was.
<br>
<br>
For weeks afterward, someone cried every Wednesday night in the Community Room.
<br>
<br>
Someone kept saying, “You should never work alone. I told her not to work alone.”
<br>
<br>
The Lusty was shut down in 2013, the dancers unable to pay after a rent increase on the building.
<br>
<br>
The Lexington closed this year–their customers displaced in the tech-crowded Mission District–and there is no longer a lesbian bar in San Francisco.
<br>
<br>
St. James Infirmary also lost their lease this year. They’ve found a new space. I hold fundraisers and hold my breath, send them cash and cross my fingers, hope and hope that they will keep their doors open.
<br>
<br>
I read that restaurateurs want to put a peep-show-themed cocktail bar where the Lusty used to be. They want to pay “homage” to the “seediness” of the place, to something they are calling its “heritage.” The cocktails, like the cocktails at every bar that’s opened in San Francisco in the last five years, will cost at least twelve dollars each. The people who can afford to drink those cocktails will play at something—edginess? danger? sex?—in a room that has been sanitized and remade as an imagined version of what it used to be.
<br>
<br>
When I read about this, my first thought is: they want everything. They want to kick us out and then pretend to be us. They want the actual dangers of our lives—the stigma and risk of violence that come with being poor and working naked—to be a thing they can purchase for an hour and then shake off, a thing that never sticks. To “pay us homage,” they need us gone. They need us gone so they can remember us without the complication of engaging with our actual lives.
<br>
<br>
Last year, Francesca died of a heroin overdose. The police found her and they did not know who she was. I walk up 14th Street, on my way to work inside the actual armory, the building whose walls we thought we’d climb. It’s no longer abandoned, was purchased by Kink.com in 2007 and turned into studios. Francesca and I did many things together—some of them drugs, some of them ugly. For a time, there was nothing I did without thinking of her. For a time, everything we did was together. I always thought that of the two of us, she was the one—the smart one, the one with talent and daring. I was certain the world would come to know her name. I want to believe, even now, especially now, that I knew who she was. That we loved each other. That everything we said in the dark was true.
<br>
<br>
Every day that I walk up 14th Street — one hundred times, two hundred times after her death—my chest goes hot and big and tight. I have the impulse to burn something—anything, everything—to build an alter of fire in front of the apartment where we lived. I want to thread a thousand dead flowers through the iron window bars. I want to climb the gate and go in the back door, to crawl through the kitchen and down the hall and lie down with my face against the gold-pale planks on the floor in the room that used to be hers and lick her graphite footprints off the ground. I want to put her ashes on my tongue. I want to go to sleep, tasting her, under the pink curtains that are no longer there.
<br>
<br>
It might be that we cannot continuously occupy any place. It might be that I never knew the things I thought I knew. That I learned a language, but now I must unlearn it.
<br>
<br>
It might be that San Francisco was my hard magic, but that there is hard magic everywhere. That people with no words for who they are might also learn them in Dallas and Cleveland and Atlanta. It might be that the packs of young men in khakis who, last year, began to roam my block, who stood in line for five dollar coffees and fifteen dollar sandwiches, who paid fifteen hundred dollars a month for a bunk in a tech dorm, are just as lost and lonely as I was fifteen years ago. It’s hard not to see their faces as uniform. Hard not to feel like there is space for them everywhere—white and young and educated and bright as they are — and no place, again, for people like me. Hard not to think of them as prospectors who will excavate, erect their tents and dig and then leave, who do not love the place itself.
<br>
<br>
But I know, too, that this is a false metaphor. I know that in many ways I am the prospector. I look at photos of the city I loved from the decades before I loved it and I see that my block downtown was full of black families, and I know that on that block there is only one black resident now. I can guess that in the Mission, in the Sunset, there were people I displaced. I can guess that my cheap rent in 2004 was someone else’s rent increase. I too made money from technology, though it was technology I did not know how to use.
<br>
<br>
By the turn of this century, the city had already changed, again and again. The city that I moved to was no longer the city of Harvey Milk or the Widow Norton. It was no longer the land of the Ohlone who resisted Spanish rule. It was no longer the city it was in 1885, when Mary Tape sued for equal access to education for her Chinese American children, writing, “I will let the world see sir, what justice there is.”
<br>
<br>
It both was and was not the city it was in 1917, when three hundred “women of the underworld” marched to the Central Methodist Church to protest police raids in the Uptown Tenderloin, to ask leaders of the Anti-Vice Crusade: “What ship are you going to send us away on?”
<br>
<br>
These cities twine through and against each other. They do not accrete toward any inexorable future. They do not unify.
<br>
<br>
When I arrived, at nineteen, I was so consumed by my own feelings of displacement that I couldn’t see what space I was already occupying.

“I don’t really believe in communities,” a young gay man said to me recently, and I had no response. I both understood and did not understand what he meant. The word, like the word pornography, has too many meanings. Who gets to say who belongs? What does belonging cost? Do I owe you something because some part of me is like some part of you? Do we even agree on our learned language? A community is nebulous. The meaning reverses and turns back on itself. Soon enough the shutter click is just a recorded sound, a placeholder for a part that no longer exists. If I tell you I’m queer, if I tell you I’m a sex worker, if I tell you I’m from San Francisco, I don’t even know what I’ve communicated. I don’t know what picture is in your head. I’ve told you so little. I want you to know who Sequoia was, who Frenchie was, but I barely know myself. I barely know who I was.
<br>
<br>
What I know is that I would not have survived without these rooms. Even with these rooms, I do not know how I survived. I do not know why I’m alive and Francesca is not. The question comes back at me again and again. I do not know. I know that something happened in the cross-hatched grid of numbered streets. Something between the rose garden and the graffitied Lex bathroom and the Community Room with its shelf of books I borrowed and traded and read all night.
<br>
<br>
The only thing I can think to do now is say things out loud. To speak people’s names. Sequoia. Francesca. To remember all the languages I’ve learned, even if they aren’t shared and never were. Even if none of us can agree on their meaning. Even if the meanings are gone or laid over with new meanings, each year a new context, each context another layer until the things we say are deeply, firmly rooted in our own histories.
<br>
<br>
I wonder if any of this talking can turn again to action. I wonder still and again what I have, what I am capable of, what I have to give. I hope and hope and hope, leaving the city that I became myself in. I hope, driving over the bridge and looking back at the unrecognizable towers above the bay, the shining silver cuts in the sky that seem to have appeared without ever having been built. I hope that wherever I go and am new again, I will find a way to be part of that place. That I will have something, anything, to hold onto when I get there. That I will know, whatever I’m holding, how to give it away.
